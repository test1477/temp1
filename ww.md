Yes, you're correct! To perform repository migrations using the **GitHub Enterprise Importer (GEi)** tool, you need to pass the **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for both the source and target organizations. These tokens are used to authenticate your access to the respective GitHub accounts.

To handle multiple repositories and use PATs effectively, you can pass the **source PAT** (`GH_SOURCE_PAT`) and **target PAT** (`GH_TARGET_PAT`) when generating the migration script.

Here’s the modified command with PATs:

### Command to Migrate Multiple Repositories with Source and Target PATs

```bash
gei-linux-amd64 generate-script \
  --github-source-repos cloud-era/repo1 cloud-era/repo2 cloud-era/repo3 cloud-era/repo4 cloud-era/repo5 cloud-era/repo6 cloud-era/repo7 cloud-era/repo8 cloud-era/repo9 cloud-era/repo10 \
  --github-target-org omega-12 \
  --github-source-token $GH_SOURCE_PAT \
  --github-target-token $GH_TARGET_PAT \
  --output multiple_repos_migration.sh
```

### Explanation:

- **`--github-source-repos cloud-era/repo1 ...`**: Specifies the source repositories from the `cloud-era` organization that you want to migrate.
  
- **`--github-target-org omega-12`**: Specifies the target organization (`omega-12`) where the repositories will be migrated.

- **`--github-source-token $GH_SOURCE_PAT`**: This flag is used to pass the **source organization’s Personal Access Token (PAT)**. 
   - Replace `$GH_SOURCE_PAT` with your actual source token or set it as an environment variable.

- **`--github-target-token $GH_TARGET_PAT`**: This flag is used to pass the **target organization’s Personal Access Token (PAT)**.
   - Replace `$GH_TARGET_PAT` with your actual target token or set it as an environment variable.

- **`--output multiple_repos_migration.sh`**: Specifies the name of the generated script that will handle the migration for all specified repositories.

### How to Set Up Environment Variables for Tokens:

To avoid hardcoding your tokens in the command, you can set the tokens as environment variables:

1. For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   export GH_SOURCE_PAT='your-source-pat'
   export GH_TARGET_PAT='your-target-pat'
   ```

2. For Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```cmd
   set GH_SOURCE_PAT=your-source-pat
   set GH_TARGET_PAT=your-target-pat
   ```

3. For PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   $env:GH_SOURCE_PAT='your-source-pat'
   $env:GH_TARGET_PAT='your-target-pat'
   ```

### Running the Generated Script:

After generating the `multiple_repos_migration.sh` script, you can run it like this:

```bash
bash multiple_repos_migration.sh
```

This will use the specified PATs to authenticate and migrate all 10 repositories from the `cloud-era` organization to the `omega-12` organization.

---

### Summary:

By passing the `GH_SOURCE_PAT` and `GH_TARGET_PAT`, the script will authenticate with both the source and target GitHub organizations to facilitate the migration process. Setting up environment variables for your PATs is a secure way to manage your tokens without exposing them directly in the script.
